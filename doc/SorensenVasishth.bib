	abstract = {This paper presents the results of an experimental study on multiple focus
	configurations, that is, structures containing two nested focus-sensitive operators
	plus two foci supposed to associate with those operators. There has been controversial
	discussion in the semantic literature regarding whether or not an interpretation is
	acceptable that corresponds to this association. While the data are unclear, the issue is
	of considerable theoretical significance, as it distinguishes between the available
	theories of focus interpretation. Some theories (e.g. Rooth‚Äôs 1992) predict such
	a pattern of association with focus to be impossible, while others (such as Wold‚Äôs
	1996) predict it to be acceptable. The results of our study show the data to be
	unacceptable rather than acceptable, favouring important aspects of the theory of
	focus interpretation developed by Rooth.}}

	abstract = {The surprisal of a word on a probabilistic grammar constitutes a promising
	complexity metric for human sentence comprehension difficulty. Using two
	different grammar types, surprisal is shown to have an effect on fixation durations
	and regression probabilities in a sample of German readers‚Äô eye movements, the
	Potsdam Sentence Corpus. A linear mixed-effects model was used to quantify the
	effect of surprisal while taking into account unigram frequency and bigram frequency
	(transitional probability), word length, and empirically-derived word predictability;
	the so-called ‚Äúearly‚Äù and ‚Äúlate‚Äù measures of processing difficulty both showed
	an effect of surprisal. Surprisal is also shown to have a small but statistically
	non-significant effect on empirically-derived predictability itself. This work thus
	demonstrates the importance of including parsing costs as a predictor of comprehension
	difficulty in models of reading, and suggests that a simple identification
	of syntactic parsing costs with early measures and late measures with durations of
	post-syntactic events may be difficult to uphold.},

	abstract = {A production study is presented that investigates the effects of word order and information structural
	context on the prosodic realization of declarative sentences in Hindi. Previous work on Hindi intonation
	has shown that: (i) non-final content words bear rising pitch accents (Moore 1965, Dyrud 2001, Nair
	1999); (ii) focused constituents show greater pitch excursion and longer duration and that post-focal
	material undergoes pitch range reduction (Moore 1965, Harnsberger 1994, Harnsberger and Judge
	1996); and (iii) focused constituents may be followed by a phrase break (Moore 1965). By means of
	a controlled experiment, we investigated the effect of focus in relation to word order variation using
	1200 utterances produced by 20 speakers. Fundamental frequency (F0) and duration of constituents
	were measured in Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) and Object-Subject-Verb (OSV) sentences in different
	information structural conditions (wide focus, subject focus and object focus). The analyses indicate
	that (i) regardless of word order and focus, the constituents are in a strict downstep relationship;
	(ii) focus is mainly characterized by post-focal pitch range reduction rather than pitch raising of the
	element in focus; (iii) given expressions that occur pre-focally appear to undergo no reduction; (iv)
	pitch excursion and duration of the constituents is higher in OSV compared to SOV sentences. A
	phonological analysis suggests that focus affects pitch scaling and that word order influences prosodic
	phrasing of the constituents.},

	volume = {25},
	issue = {2},
	pages = {221-244},
	abstract = {Background: In addition to the canonical subject-verb-object (SVO) word order, German also allows for non-canonical order (OVS), and the case-marking system supports thematic role interpretation. Previous eye-tracking studies (Kamide et al., 2003; Knoeferle, 2007) have shown that unambiguous case information in non-canonical sentences is processed incrementally. For individuals with agrammatic aphasia, comprehension of non-canonical sentences is at chance level (Burchert et al., 2003). The trace deletion hypothesis (Grodzinsky 1995, 2000) claims that this is due to structural impairments in syntactic representations, which force the individual with aphasia (IWA) to apply a guessing strategy. However, recent studies investigating online sentence processing in aphasia (Caplan et al., 2007; Dickey et al., 2007) found that divergences exist in IWAs' sentence-processing routines depending on whether they comprehended non-canonical sentences correctly or not, pointing rather to a processing deficit explanation. 
	Aims: The aim of the current study was to investigate agrammatic IWAs' online and offline sentence comprehension simultaneously in order to reveal what online sentence-processing strategies they rely on and how these differ from controls' processing routines. We further asked whether IWAs' offline chance performance for non-canonical sentences does indeed result from guessing. 
	Methods & Procedures: We used the visual-world paradigm and measured eye movements (as an index of online sentence processing) of controls (N = 8) and individuals with aphasia (N = 7) during a sentence-picture matching task. Additional offline measures were accuracy and reaction times. 
	Outcomes & Results: While the offline accuracy results corresponded to the pattern predicted by the TDH, IWAs' eye movements revealed systematic differences depending on the response accuracy. 
	Conclusions: These findings constitute evidence against attributing IWAs' chance performance for non-canonical structures to mere guessing. Instead, our results support processing deficit explanations and characterise the agrammatic parser as deterministic and inefficient: it is slowed down, affected by intermittent deficiencies in performing syntactic operations, and fails to compute reanalysis even when one is detected.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we explore the use of abductive reasoning
		  to control knowledge base interactions. This control is
		  achieved by means of the maintenance of dynamically
		  changing knowledge bases. Such knowledge bases occur in
		  interactive systems, where they contain information about
		  the changing context of the interaction or dialogue.
		  Abduction is used in a number of ways. It is used to
		  assimilate or explain new information and update the
		  context accordingly. This is already a well-known
		  application of abduction. In addition, it can be used to
		  perform various kinds of reasoning such as default
		  reasoning, and planning of the next knowledge state, via
		  the use of additional predicates such as "abnormal" and
		  "anomalous". The paper contains an explanation of the
		  reasoning patterns involved and an extended example
		  relating to dialogue management in the ESPRIT PLUS project.

	abstract = {We present a detailed process theory of the moment-by-moment working-memory retrievals and associated
	control structure that subserve sentence comprehension. The theory is derived from the application
	of independently motivated principles of memory and cognitive skill to the specialized task of sentence
	parsing. The resulting theory construes sentence processing as a series of skilled associative
	memory retrievals modulated by similarity-based interference and fluctuating activation. The cognitive
	principles are formalized in computational form in the Adaptive Control of Thought‚ÄìRational (ACT‚ÄìR)
	architecture, and our process model is realized inACT‚ÄìR.We present the results of 6 sets of simulations:
	5 simulation sets provide quantitative accounts of the effects of length and structural interference on
	both unambiguous and garden-path structures. A final simulation set provides a graded taxonomy of
	double center embeddings ranging from relatively easy to extremely difficult. The explanation of center-
	embedding difficulty is a novel one that derives from the model‚Äôs complete reliance on discriminating
	retrieval cues in the absence of an explicit representation of serial order information. All fits were obtained
	with only 1 free scaling parameter fixed across the simulations; all other parameters were ACT‚ÄìR
	defaults. The modeling results support the hypothesis that fluctuating activation and similarity-based interference
	are the key factors shaping working memory in sentence processing. We contrast the theory
	and empirical predictions with several related accounts of sentence-processing complexity.},

This research suggests that this generalization may not be true across languages: the distance between arguments and verbs could affect the ease with which the for- mer can be integrated with the latter, and sufficiently increasing this distance makes processing difficult, regardless of discourse context.},

  	abstract = {The analysis of experimental data with mixed-effects models requires
decisions about the specification of the appropriate random-effects structure.
Recently, Barr, et al 2013, recommended  fitting `maximal'
models with all possible random effect components included.  Estimation of
maximal models, however, may not converge.  We show that failure to converge
 typically is not due to a suboptimal estimation algorithm, but is
a consequence of attempting to fit a model that is too complex to be properly
supported by the data, irrespective of whether estimation is based on maximum
likelihood or on Bayesian hierarchical modeling with uninformative or weakly
informative priors.  Importantly, even under convergence, overparameterization
may lead to uninterpretable models.  We provide diagnostic tools for detecting
overparameterization and guiding model simplification.  Finally, we clarify
that the simulations on which Barr et al. base their recommendations are
atypical for real data.  A detailed example is provided of how subject-related
attentional fluctuation across trials may further qualify
statistical inferences about fixed effects, and of how such nonlinear effects
can be accommodated within the mixed-effects modeling framework.}

	cue-based retrieval, constrained by independently motivated working memory principles
	defined in a cognitive architecture (ACT-R). To demonstrate this, we investigate an
	unusual instance of dependency resolution, the processing of negative and positive
	polarity items, and confirm a surprising prediction of the cue-based retrieval model:
	partial cue-matches, which constitute a kind of similarity-based interference? can give
	rise to the intrusion of ungrammatical retrieval candidates, leading to both processing
	slow-downs and even errors of judgment that take the form of illusions of grammaticality
	in patently ungrammatical structures. A notable achievement is that good quantitative
	fits are achieved without adjusting the key model parameters.},

  abstract = {Seven experiments using self-paced reading and eyetracking suggest that omitting the middle verb in a double centre embedding leads to easier processing in English but leads to greater difficulty in German. One commonly accepted explanation for the English pattern‚Äîbased on data from offline acceptability ratings and due to Gibson and Thomas (1999)‚Äîis that working-memory overload leads the comprehender to forget the prediction of the upcoming verb phrase (VP), which reduces working-memory load. We show that this VP-forgetting hypothesis does an excellent job of explaining the English data, but cannot account for the German results. We argue that the English and German results can be explained by the parser's adaptation to the grammatical properties of the languages; in contrast to English, German subordinate clauses always have the verb in clause-final position, and this property of German may lead the German parser to maintain predictions of upcoming VPs more robustly compared to English. The evidence thus argues against language-independent forgetting effects in online sentence processing; working-memory constraints can be conditioned by countervailing influences deriving from grammatical properties of the language under study.}

	Abstract = {This article reports on a crosslinguistic comparative study of the processing of Japanese relative clauses (RCs) by Chinese-, Sinhalese-, Vietnamese-, Thai-, and Indonesian-speaking second language (L2) learners. A robust finding in studies on the acquisition of RCs in L2 English and other European languages is that subject-gap RCs are easier than object-gap RCs, both in production and comprehension. However, in the case of L2 Japanese studies, the picture does not seem to be as clear as in the English case. This study identifies some factors that might contribute to this situation. The results of a listening comprehension test involving reversible and nonreversible test sentences show that the five groups of learners overall found subject-gap RCs easier to process than object-gap RCs, but that their performances are poor and vary for sentence types in which no semantic cue is available to help identify the grammatical function of the overt noun phrase in RCs, yielding inconclusive results with respect to the question of whether subject-gap RCs are easier than object-gap RCs. Results indicate that when RCs are too difficult for learners to process, first language properties such as head direction, word order, and the relative order of filler and gap affect the manner in which they are interpreted.},

This paper seeks to resolve this issue and to extend our understanding of SLA in general by investigating the interpretation of subject and direct object relative clauses by English-speaking learners of Korean, a left-branching language in which subject gaps in relative clauses are more distant from the head than are object gaps. The results of a comprehension task conducted with 53 beginning and intermediate learners point toward a strong preference for subject relative clauses, favoring the structural account.},

		for ungrammatical structures is based on working-memory
		overload: the claim is that the prediction for an upcoming
		verb phrase is forgotten due to memory overload, leading to an
		illusion of grammaticality (Gibson & Thomas, 1999). However,
		this memory-overload account cannot explain the recent
		finding by Vasishth, Suckow, Lewis, and Kern (2008) that in
		German no illusion of ungrammaticality occurs. We present a
		simple recurrent network model that can explain both the presence
		of the grammaticality illusion in English and its absence

		as a function of experience with language-specific structures,
		not working memory constraints as argued for in Gibson and

but the specific cognitive mechanisms reflected in these measures are not well
understood. This study finds support in German readers‚Äô eye fixations for two
distinct difficulty metrics: surprisal, which reflects the change in probabilities
across syntactic analyses as new words are integrated; and retrieval, which
quantifies comprehension difficulty in terms of working memory constraints.We
examine the predictions of both metrics using a family of dependency parsers
indexed by an upper limit on the number of candidate syntactic analyses they
retain at successive words. Surprisal models all fixation measures and regression
probability. By contrast, retrieval does not model any measure in serial
processing. As more candidate analyses are considered in parallel at each word,
retrieval can account for the same measures as surprisal. This pattern suggests an
important role for ranked parallelism in theories of sentence comprehension.},

  abstract = {Many comprehension theories assert that increasing the distance between elements participating in a
linguistic relation (e.g., a verb and a noun phrase argument) increases the difficulty of establishing that
relation during on-line comprehension. Such locality effects are expected to increase reading times and
are thought to reveal properties and limitations of the short-term memory system that supports comprehension.
Despite their theoretical importance and putative ubiquity, however, evidence for on-line
locality effects is quite narrow linguistically and methodologically: It is restricted almost exclusively to
self-paced reading of complex structures involving a particular class of syntactic relation. We present 4
experiments (2 self-paced reading and 2 eyetracking experiments) that demonstrate locality effects in the
course of establishing subject‚Äìverb dependencies; locality effects are seen even in materials that can be
read quickly and easily. These locality effects are observable in the earliest possible eye-movement
measures and are of much shorter duration than previously reported effects. To account for the observed
empirical patterns, we outline a processing model of the adaptive control of button pressing and eye
movements. This model makes progress toward the goal of eliminating linking assumptions between
memory constructs and empirical measures in favor of explicit theories of the coordinated control of
motor responses and parsing.}

    abstract = {<p>A general fact about language is that subject relative clauses are easier to process than object relative clauses. Recently, several self-paced reading studies have presented surprising evidence that object relatives in Chinese are <italic>easier</italic> to process than subject relatives. We carried out three self-paced reading experiments that attempted to replicate these results. Two of our three studies found a subject-relative preference, and the third study found an object-relative advantage. Using a random effects bayesian meta-analysis of fifteen studies (including our own), we show that the overall current evidence for the subject-relative advantage is quite strong (approximate posterior probability of a subject-relative advantage given the data: 78–80%). We argue that retrieval/integration based accounts would have difficulty explaining all three experimental results. These findings are important because they narrow the theoretical space by limiting the role of an important class of explanation—retrieval/integration cost—at least for relative clause processing in Chinese.</p>},

	reanalysis strategies?  Several influential eye-tracking studies on syntactic
	reanalysis (Frazier & Rayner 1982, Meseguer et al 2002, Mitchell et al 2008) have
	examined scanpaths---sequences of eye fixations---to answer this question.
	However, in the absence of a suitable method for analyzing scanpaths, these studies
	relied on simplified dependent measures that are arguably ambiguous and hard to
	interpret.  We address the theoretical question of repair strategy by developing
	a new method that quantifies scanpath similarity.  Our method reveals several
	distinct fixation strategies associated with reanalysis that went undetected in
	a previously published data set (Meseguer et al 2002).  One prevalent pattern
	suggests re-parsing of the sentence, a strategy that has been proposed in the
	literature (Frazier & Rayner 1982); however, readers differed tremendously in
	how they orchestrated the various fixation strategies.  Our results raise the
	possibility that the human parsing system non-deterministically adopts different
	strategies when confronted with the need to reanalyze.},

	Year = {2012},
    abstract = {Two Hindi eyetracking studies show that clefting a noun results in greater processing difficulty initially,
	due to the extra processing steps involved in encoding a clefted noun (e.g., for computing the
	exhaustiveness interpretation). However, this extra difficulty in encoding a clefted noun results in a
	processing advantage when the clefted noun needs to be retrieved later on in the sentence -- the clefted
	noun is retrieved faster in subsequent processing compared to its non-clefted counterpart. This effect
	is short-lived, however; it does not last beyond the current sentence. We also show that given-new
	ordering yields a processing advantage over new-given order, but this is only seen after the whole
	sentence is processed, i.e., it is a late effect that occurs after syntactic processing is completed. Finally,
	following up on work on German by Hoernig et al. (2005), we present evidence that non-canonical order
	can be processed more easily than canonical order given appropriate context.},

	        abstract = {Three experiments (self-paced reading, eyetracking and an
	ERP study) show that in relative clauses, increasing the distance be
	tween the relativized noun and the relative-clause verb makes it more
	difficult to process the relative-clause verb (the so-called locality effect).
	This result is consistent with the predictions of several theories (Gibson 2000, Lewis and Vasishth 2005), and contradicts the recent claim
	(Levy 2008) that in relative-clause structures increasing argument-verb
	distance makes processing easier at the verb. Levy's expectation-based
	account predicts that the expectation for a verb becomes sharper as dis-
	tance is increased and therefore processing becomes easier at the verb.
	We argue that, in addition to expectation effects (which are seen in the
	eyetracking study in first-pass regression probability), processing load
	also increases with increasing distance. This contradicts Levy's claim
	that heightened expectation leads to lower processing cost. Dependency-
	resolution cost and expectation-based facilitation are jointly responsible
	for determining processing cost.}

abstract = {Previous work (Boston et al., 2011) has shown that surprisal (Hale, 2001) and retrieval difficulty (Lewis \& Vasishth, 2005) are significant predictors of reading time in the Potsdam Sentence Corpus (PSC). It remains an open question how such measures of parsing difficulty interact with eye movement control processes (Reichle et al., 2009). We investigate this interaction using the eye movement control model EMMA (Salvucci, 2001), a serial attention shift model similar to E-Z Reader, which is integrated in the cognitive architecture ACT-R. Several simulation studies are presented that explore the possibilities of incorporating surprisal and retrieval in an ACT- R/EMMA model. The ACT-R model interacts with EMMA by shifting attention from word to word. The model includes a post-lexical integration stage inspired by Reichle et al. (2009), that triggers short regressions on high difficulty. A baseline study evaluates the performance of the latest EMMA implementation in ACT-R 6.0 on the sentences of the English Schilling Corpus, thereby replicating the original study by Salvucci (2001) in the latest version of the ACT-R architectural environment. The model reproduces effects of word frequency for gaze duration, first fixation duration, single fixation duration, and the probabilities of skipping, one fixation, and two+ fixations (mean correlation r = 0.96, RMSD = 0.220). In a second simulation the same model is applied to the German Potsdam Sentence Corpus (r = 0.89, RMSD = 0.285). Further simulations include surprisal, retrieval, and both, respectively, and are qualitatively evaluated on data of the PSC. Retrieval values (calculated by Boston, 2011, under independently motivated assumptions of ACT-R theory) are used to define the duration of the integration stage. Surprisal was tested in different configurations: (a) modulating integration time and (b) directly integrated in EMMA’s equation of word encoding time. Configuration (b) is motivated by experimental and corpus work (e.g., Boston, 2011; Vasishth \& Drenhaus, 2011) suggesting that surprisal may show early effects in the eye movement record more reliably than retrieval does. Our implementation of surprisal and retrieval, although resting on simplified assumptions, enables the model to reproduce general effects of both measures on reading time as observed in the PSC data (retrieval: r = 0.67, RMSD = 0.156; surprisal[b]: r = 0.81, RMSD = 0.309). The model predictions for frequency effects improve with the incorporation of surprisal[a] (RMSD = 0.232), retrieval (RMSD = 0.200) and in a model containing both predictors (RMSD = 0.199). The overall goodness of fit for word-by-word gaze duration improves only when surprisal is included (r = 0.45, RMSD = 0.983, vs. for the baseline: r = 0.39, RMSD 0.991). This work provides a first qualitative demonstration of an integrated, flexible framework incorporating two complementary measures of parsing difficulty interacting with eye movement control on different levels. It serves as a foundational step for future work on a precise investigation of the interactions between high- level language processing and eye movements.},

	content. The results are generally consistent with the claim that

	that the Late Closure parsing strategy fails to apply across all

@article{Grodzinsky:1995,
	Abstract = {In this paper I propose a new, restrictive theory of Trace-Deletion in agrammatism. This theory subsumes the Trace-Deletion Hypothesis (TDH; Grodzinsky, 1984a,b, 1986, 1990), which maintains that traces are deleted from agrammatic representations and that a cognitive strategy augments the patients' performance. This claim accounts for the pattern of loss and sparing observed in these patients' comprehension of a wide variety of syntactic constructions and is thus important for our understanding of the neural representation of syntax. Yet there are reasons for revising the account and making it more precise, stemming from both recent empirical findings and new developments in the theory of syntax. The original TDH was based on observations of agrammatic comprehension of structures containing traces resulting from either NP- or Wh-movement. Nevertheless, heads (as opposed to phrasal projections) also move and leave traces behind. Head movement (of verbs, for instance) has come to play a central role in linguistic theory (which currently postulates a wider variety of empty categories than any previous theoretical framework). Recent findings suggest that verb movement is retained in agrammatism, indicating that a sweeping claim regarding the deletion of all empty categories is too strong. This motivates the first restrictive move, resulting in a theory that picks out a restricted set of traces--only those for which deficient performance is indeed observed. All other empty categories are left intact. Trace-Deletion is tied to theta-positions. The second restrictive move is motivated by two types of surprising asymmetries that have recently been discovered for agrammatic comprehenders: First, agrammatic comprehension on passives of psychological predicates provides an error pattern that distinguishes this construction from agentive passive, indicating that the deficit is tied to the thematic properties of the predicate: Second, asymmetries have been observed in agrammatic comprehension of questions and quantifiers. These findings motivate a modification of the augmentative strategy, whose domain of application is restricted to referential NPs. Thus, the new account amounts to the claim that only traces in theta-positions are deleted, and that the strategy applies to referential NPs alone. This, I argue, not only derives all the data precisely but is also conceptually superior to any previous account of agrammatism. Finally, I discuss the consequences of this account to linguistic theory, and to theories of brain/language relations.},

@article{Dickey:2007a,
	Abstract = {Sentences with non-canonical wh- movement are often difficult for individuals with agrammatic Broca's aphasia to understand (, inter alia). However, the explanation of this difficulty remains controversial, and little is known about how individuals with aphasia try to understand such sentences in real time. This study uses an eyetracking while listening paradigm to examine agrammatic aphasic individuals' on-line comprehension of movement sentences. Participants' eye-movements were monitored while they listened to brief stories and looked at visual displays depicting elements mentioned in the stories. The stories were followed by comprehension probes involving wh- movement. In line with previous results for young normal listeners [Sussman, R. S., \& Sedivy, J. C. (2003). The time-course of processing syntactic dependencies: evidence from eye movements. Language and Cognitive Processes, 18, 143-161], the study finds that both older unimpaired control participants (n=8) and aphasic individuals (n=12) showed visual evidence of successful automatic comprehension of wh- questions (like "Who did the boy kiss that day at school?"). Specifically, both groups fixated on a picture corresponding to the moved element ("who," the person kissed in the story) at the position of the verb. Interestingly, aphasic participants showed qualitatively different fixation patterns for trials eliciting correct and incorrect responses. Aphasic individuals looked first to the moved-element picture and then to a competitor following the verb in the incorrect trials. However, they only showed looks to the moved-element picture for the correct trials, parallel to control participants. Furthermore, aphasic individuals' fixations during movement sentences were just as fast as control participants' fixations. These results are unexpected under slowed-processing accounts of aphasic comprehension deficits, in which the source of failed comprehension should be delayed application of the same processing routines used in successful comprehension. This pattern is also unexpected if aphasic individuals are using qualitatively different strategies than normals to comprehend such sentences, as under impaired-representation accounts of agrammatism. Instead, it suggests that agrammatic aphasic individuals may process wh- questions similarly to unimpaired individuals, but that this process often fails to facilitate off-line comprehension of sentences with wh- movement.},

abstract = {We explore the interaction between oculomotor control and language com- prehension on the sentence level using two well-tested computational ac- counts of parsing difficulty. Previous work (Boston, Hale, Vasishth, \& Kliegl, 2011) has shown that surprisal (Hale, 2001; Levy, 2008) and cue-based mem- ory retrieval (Lewis \& Vasishth, 2005) are significant and complementary predictors of reading time in an eyetracking corpus. It remains an open question how the sentence processor interacts with oculomotor control. Us- ing a simple linking hypothesis proposed in Reichle, Warren, and McConnell (2009), we integrated both measures with the eye movement model EMMA (Salvucci, 2001) inside the cognitive architecture ACT-R (Anderson et al., 2004). We built a reading model that could initiate short “Time Out re- gressions” (Mitchell, Shen, Green, \& Hodgson, 2008) that compensate for slow postlexical processing. This simple interaction enabled the model to predict the re-reading of words based on parsing difficulty. The model was evaluated in different configurations on the prediction of frequency effects on the Potsdam Sentence Corpus. The extension of EMMA with postlexi- cal processing improved its predictions and reproduced re-reading rates and durations with a reasonable fit to the data. This demonstration, based on simple and independently motivated assumptions, serves as a foundational step toward a precise investigation of the interaction between high-level lan- guage processing and eye movement control.},

present, simple past and past participle (present perfect) was tested
in German by means of a sentence completion task with a group of seven
speakers with agrammatic aphasia. The results show a difference
between regular verbs and irregular verbs. Mixed verbs were equally
difficult as irregular verbs. A frequency effect was found for
irregular verbs but not for regular and mixed verbs. A significant
difference among the correctness scores for present tense and simple
past forms was found. Simple past and past participle were
significantly more difficult than present tense. Error types were
characterized by pure infinitive responses and time reference errors.
Neither of the above accounts is sufficient to explain these results.
Correctness scores and error patterns for mixed verbs suggest that
such minor lexical patterns can be useful in finding new evidence in
the debate on morphological processing. The findings also highlight
time reference as well as language specific characteristics need to be
taken into consideration.},

The present eye-tracking study, which investigated processing of attachment ambiguities of an adjunct in Spanish, suggests that readers sometimes underspecify attachment to save memory resources, consistent with the good-enough account of parsing. Our results confirm a surprising prediction of the good-enough account: high-capacity readers commit to an attachment decision more often than low-capacity participants, leading to more errors and a greater need to reanalyze in garden-path sentences.  These results emerged only when we separated functionally different types of regressive eye movements using a scanpath analysis; conventional eye-tracking measures alone would have led to different conclusions.  The scanpath analysis also showed that rereading was the dominant strategy for recovering from garden-pathing.  Our results may also have broader implications for models of reading processes: reanalysis effects in eye movements occurred late, which suggests that the coupling of oculo-motor control and the parser may not always be as tight as assumed in current computational models of eye movements control in reading.},

@inproceedings{Engelmann2013,
abstract = {Reichle et al. (Psychonomic Bulletin \& Review, 2009) proposed two kinds of interaction between post-lexical processing and oculomotor control: (1) "slow integration failure": A time-out regression when post-lexical integration is lagged; and (2) "rapid integration failure": A regression when integration fails. Boston et al. (Eye Movement Research, 2008; Language and Cognitive Processes, 2011) showed that memory retrieval (Lewis \& Vasishth, Cognitive Science, 2005) and syntactic surprisal (Hale, NAACL, 2001; Levy, Cognition, 2008) are significant predictors of eye movements in the Potsdam Sentence Corpus. We implemented the proposed interaction of the first kind in the cognitive architecture ACT-R and evaluated the model on the Potsdam Sentence Corpus using pre-calculated values from Boston et al. (2008, 2011). The model's prediction of 11 fixation measures including second-pass durations and regression rates was grouped by classes of word frequency and fitted to the data with a resulting root-mean-square error of 0.206 and a correlation R of 0.9. Based on this evaluation we present work in progress that uses the parser of Lewis \& Vasishth (2005) for a direct interaction of eye movement control with parsing rules and implements rapid integration failure resulting in long-range regressions guided by active repair attempts.},

We conducted an experiment to see if this correspondence also holds for oscillatory brain dynamics. Participants (N=48) read true ("The Thames flows through London") and false factual statements ("The Hudson flows through London"). Such violations are known to elicit an N400, a negative-going deflection with a peak around 400 ms, and increased theta and gamma activity (Hagoort, Science, 2004). As expected, we see an N400 in the FRP and increased fixation durations and regression rates in the eye movement record. Moreover, a cluster-permutation test (Maris & Oostenveld, J Neurosci Methods, 2007) for fixation-related power spectra shows synchronization in the delta range (1-3 Hz) and desynchronization in the upper alpha range (11-13 Hz) but no theta or gamma effects. This is at odds with prior findings and suggests that fixation-related oscillatory EEG changes are not fully comparable to those observed in RSVP. One reason for the diverging results may lie in different processing demands: In RSVP, readers must retrieve earlier parts of the sentence from memory because they cannot make regressions.},

@inproceedings{Metzner2013b,
        Abstract = {Recent studies (Dimigen et al., JEP:G, 2011; Kretzschmar et al., NeuroReport, 2009) demonstrated the feasibility of investigating fixation-related potentials (FRPs) and that the results are similar to brain potentials recorded during rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP). We conducted an experiment to assess if this correspondence also holds for rhythmic brain activity. To pit our results against results gained with RSVP, the experiment used sentences that are known to produce reliable effects both in the time domain and in the frequency domain (Hagoort, Science, 2004). Participants (N=48) read freely through true ("The Thames flows through London") and false statements ("The Hudson flows through London"). Hagoort et al. report an N400, a negative-going deflection in the ERP with a peak around 400 ms, as well as increased theta (4-7 Hz) and gamma (30-70 Hz) activity. During our experiment, participants' eye movements were monitored and their EEG was recorded from 32 electrodes and later evaluated contingent to the first fixation on the critical word. We analyzed the canonical eye-tracking measures with linear mixed-effects models and the EEG with cluster-permutation tests (Maris & Oostenveld, J Neurosci Methods, 2007) to control for multiple comparisons. As expected, we observed a negativity in the FRP with a centro-parietal distribution and a peak latency of approximately 400 ms. Also as expected, this N400 lined up with increased first fixation durations, gaze durations, and regression rates in the eye movement record (Dambacher & Kliegl, Brain Res, 2007). Crucially, fixation-related power spectra showed synchronization in the delta range (1-3 Hz) at central electrodes and desynchronization in the upper alpha range (11-13 Hz) at occipito-parietal sites relative to a pre-fixation baseline. None of these effects is reported by Hagoort et al. which suggests that fixation-related EEG changes are at least not fully comparable to those observed in RSVP. One reason for the diverging results could lie in different processing demands: In RSVP, readers must retrieve earlier parts of the sentence from working memory because they cannot make regressions. Increased theta activity reflects this more effortful memory access (Klimesch, Brain Res Rev, 1999). In natural reading, readers can easily move their eyes back to resolve the processing difficulty which facilitates memory access. Our findings question the comparability of results acquired with serial presentation vs. natural reading.},

@article{Reitter-EtAl-2011,
	Abstract = {The psycholinguistic literature has identified two syntactic adaptation effects in language production: rapidly decaying short-term priming and long-lasting adaptation. To explain both effects, we present an ACT-R model of syntactic priming based on a wide-coverage, lexicalized syntactic theory that explains priming as facilitation of lexical access. In this model, two well-established ACT-R mechanisms, base-level learning and spreading activation, account for long-term adaptation and short-term priming, respectively. Our model simulates incremental language production and in a series of modeling studies we show that it accounts for (a)~the inverse frequency interaction; (b)~the absence of a decay in long-term priming; and (c)~the cumulativity of long-term adaptation. The model also explains the lexical boost effect and the fact that it only applies to short-term priming. We also present corpus data that verifies a prediction of the model, i.e., that the lexical boost affects all lexical material, rather than just heads.},

  abstract = {Pioneering work in reading research has shown that scanpaths in reading can be informative about sentences processing (Frazier, Rayner, 1982). Nevertheless, scanpaths have not gained much traction in reading research. One reason for that may have been a lack of suitable analytical tools. Here, we summarize three recent studies in which we used a new scanpath measure to analyze gaze data from two experimental studies (von der Malsburg, Vasishth, 2011, 2012) and one corpus study (von der Malsburg, Kliegl, Vasishth, under revision). The experiments investigated how readers process temporarily ambiguous sentences. We showed that readers do not always commit to one of the alternative interpretations, and that readers with low working-memory capacity do so less often. Contrary to what was reported earlier, we found that reparsing instead of targeted repair is a common strategy to recover from incorrect interpretations. Interestingly, these results did not emerge in an analysis using traditional word-based eyetracking measures showing their limitations. In the corpus study, we demonstrated how syntax, oculomotor constraints, and age of reader jointly determine the regularity of scanpaths. We argue that, taken together, these results establish the scanpath as an informative and tractable object of investigation in reading research.},

  abstract = {Recent research demonstrated the feasibility of analyzing fixation-related brain potentials (FRPs) recorded during natural reading (Kretzschmar et al., 2009; Dimigen et al., 2011). Two questions arise from these studies: (1) Are effects observed with fixation-triggered EEG signals comparable to those observed in standard RSVP designs? (2) Does the combined analysis of EEG and fixation data provide additional insights into reading and comprehension processes that are not available with either method alone? Both above-mentioned studies used material known to robustly elicit strong N400 effects. The present study (N=50) examined responses to a more subtle manipulation representative of common experimental designs: we manipulated the distance between anaphoric expressions (pronouns, verb ellipsis) and their antecedents. Differences were examined using a non-parametric Monte Carlo test (Maris & Oostenveld, 2007). Increased distance of the antecedent elicited an early frontocentral negativity in response to verb ellipses (88ms-134ms, p<0.001) and a negativity at frontocentral and parietal electrodes on the words following pronouns (98ms-186ms, p<0.001). We discuss these results in the context of earlier findings and argue that adopting FRP-methodology requires factoring in complex visuomotor contingencies that are not yet fully understood and that evoke ERP effects different from those seen in RSVP designs.}

  abstract = {Recent research (Dimigen et al., JEP:G, 2011; Kretzschmar et al., NeuroReport, 2009) shows that fixation-related potentials (FRPs) yield similar results as brain potentials recorded during rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP). We conducted an experiment to see if this correspondence also holds for oscillatory brain dynamics. Participants (N=48) read true ("The Thames flows through London") and false factual statements ("The Hudson flows through London"). Such violations are known to elicit an N400, a negative-going deflection with a peak around 400 ms, and increased theta and gamma activity (Hagoort, Science, 2004). As expected, we see an N400 in the FRP and increased fixation durations and regression rates in the eye movement record. Moreover, a cluster-permutation test (Maris & Oostenveld, J Neurosci Methods, 2007) for fixation-related power spectra shows synchronization in the delta range (1-3 Hz) and desynchronization in the upper alpha range (11-13 Hz) but no theta or gamma effects. This is at odds with prior findings and suggests that fixation-related oscillatory EEG changes are not fully comparable to those observed in RSVP. One reason for the diverging results may lie in different processing demands: In RSVP, readers must retrieve earlier parts of the sentence from memory because they cannot make regressions.}

abstract = {In this chapter, we focus on a previously ignored aspect of sentence processing theories: is processing difficulty caused by reanalysis or competition? According to two-stage theories (e.g., Frazier, 1979; Rayner, Frazier, \{\&\} Carlson, 1983), reanalysis should occur when an initially adopted reading is inappropriate. In contrast, current constraint-based theories (e.g., MacDonald, 1994; McRae, Spivey-Knowlton, \{\&\} Tanenhaus, 1998) claim that processing difficulty is due to a competition between two or more syntactic analyses that are about equally activated. We review a number of eye-tracking experiments investigating this issue. No competition was observed in any of the experiments, thus ruling out current constraint-based theories. In fact, the opposite pattern emerged: sentences that should have produced processing difficulty according to constraint-based theories were actually easier to process than sentences that should not have produced difficulty. The data also turn out to be problematic for two-stage theories, as non-syntactic information appears to be employed before the point of reanalysis. The data provide evidence for a new model of syntactic ambiguity resolution (cf. Traxler, Pickering, \{\&\} Clifton, 1998; Van Gompel, Pickering, \{\&\} Traxler, 1999), the unrestricted race model. In this model, processing difficulty is due to reanalysis, but multiple sources of information can determine which analysis is initially adopted.},

** The model is nondeterministic, i.e if there is a strong bias, the respective analysis will almost always be chose - if the bias is weak, it will be chosen most often, but not quite as often as in a strong ambiguity - if the ambiguity is balanced, each reading will be chosen around half the time. Thus, strength has a stochastic effect on the reading which is chosen. This bahaviour is supposed to explain the contrast between strong and weak garden path strengths.
--> In weaky biased ambiguities, reanalysis will have to happen in a little bit more than 50\% of the case. In strongly biased ones, it has to happen much more often.
--> One clear prediction is that the strength of a garden path is determined by the mean, but the range of reaction times should be the same, whether the garden path is strong or weak. Thus, given the same ambiguity with different preferences and the same reanalysis procedure, the distribution of *reanalysis* times should be the same. Since both (weak and strong) GPs are supposed to have more than 50\% reanalysis cases (at least according to Gompel, Pickering \{\&\} Traxler) - these upper 50\% should have roughly the same distribution in strong and weak garden paths. The lower 50\%, however, should have a smaller mean in weak garden path reanalysis.

  abstract = {Expectation-driven facilitation (Hale, 2001; Levy, 2008) and locality-driven retrieval difficulty (Gibson, 1998, 2000; Lewis &
Vasishth, 2005) are widely recognized to be two critical factors in incremental sentence processing; there is accumulating
evidence that both can influence processing difficulty. However, it is unclear whether and how expectations and memory
interact. We first confirm a key prediction of the expectation account: a Hindi self-paced reading study shows that when an
expectation for an upcoming part of speech is dashed, building a rarer structure consumes more processing time than
building a less rare structure. This is a strong validation of the expectation-based account. In a second study, we show that
when expectation is strong, i.e., when a particular verb is predicted, strong facilitation effects are seen when the appearance
of the verb is delayed; however, when expectation is weak, i.e., when only the part of speech ``verb'' is predicted but a
particular verb is not predicted, the facilitation disappears and a tendency towards a locality effect is seen. The interaction
seen between expectation strength and distance shows that strong expectations cancel locality effects, and that weak
expectations allow locality effects to emerge.},
