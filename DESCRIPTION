Description: This package provides the code accompanying the paper by Sorensen and Vasishth on fitting linear mixed models using Stan. We provide an example for a two-condition repeated measures design, a 2x2 repeated measures factorial design, and some other more complex designs.
Depends: R (>= 3.1.0), rstan(>=2.6)
Suggests: lme4(>= 1.1), knitr
